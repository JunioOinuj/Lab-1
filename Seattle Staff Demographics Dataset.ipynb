    "In this lab we want to be able to tell a story with the dataset we downloaded. More specifically, the story between the Age and Hourly Rate data with the City of Seattle Staff Demographics Dataset (from https://data.seattle.gov/City-Business/City-of-Seattle-Staff-Demographics/5avq-r9hj). This dataset is important to analyze because it shows the people who work for the City of Seattle and their ages and how much they are paid. From this information, we will be able to draw engaging questions about this particular dataset.   "
